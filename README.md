# Customer-churn
Customer churn, or attrition, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company over a specific period. It's a key metric for measuring customer loyalty and business health, as high churn indicates dissatisfaction and directly impacts revenue. Lowering churn is a primary goal for any business.
